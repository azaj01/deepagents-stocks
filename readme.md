# üìä Stock Research Agent ‚Äì Version 2


* [Version 2](./deep-research-agents-v2)



## üöÄ Overview

This is the **second version** of the Stock Research Agent built with Gradio, LangChain DeepAgents, and optional Brave/Tavily integration. It improves significantly over the first version by applying **context engineering**, simplifying configuration, and optimizing tool usage.

## üìä Version Comparison (v1 vs v2)

| Feature                   | Version 1 (Old)        | Version 2 (New)                             |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Configuration**         | Hardcoded in `.py`     | `.env`, `.json`, `.md` external configs     |
| **Search Provider**       | Fixed to Brave         | Optional Brave/Tavily, auto-selected        |
| **Subagents**             | Defined inline in code | Externalized in `subagents.json`            |
| **Core Instructions**     | Inline (long)          | Moved to `instructions.md`                  |
| **Token Usage per Query** | \~13,000               | \~3,500                                     |
| **Response Time**         | Slow (bloated context) | 60‚Äì70% faster (context engineered)          |
| **UI**                    | Basic textbox          | Markdown + Chat UI                          |
| **Error Handling**        | Minimal                | Graceful fallbacks, provider status banners |

## üìâ Token Usage Optimization

* **Before (v1):** \~13,000 tokens per research query (bloated instructions + redundant context).
* **Now (v2):** \~3,500 tokens per query.
* Achieved through:

  * Externalizing prompts (`.md` + `.json` files).
  * Removing redundant instructions.
  * Adding clear tool descriptions.
  * Context-aware selective tool usage.

üí∞ **Impact:** Reducing from 13k ‚Üí 3.5k tokens saves \~73% in API costs and improves response latency by 60‚Äì70%.

## üìö New Learnings & Best Practices

### üîÑ Handling Recursion Limits

* When deep agents or tools recurse too much, Python may throw a `RecursionError`.
* **Avoid simply increasing the recursion limit** ‚Äî it may hide design flaws or cause infinite loops.
* Instead:

  * Set clear stopping conditions in agents.
  * Limit maximum depth of reasoning/tool calls.
  * Use guardrails in prompts to discourage looping.

### üìù Prompt & Tool Definition Practices

* Keep prompts **precise** and **minimal**.
* Avoid duplicate phrases across instructions and sub-agent definitions (they bloat token count).
* Provide **short, structured tool descriptions** instead of verbose text.
* Define workflows clearly so the model doesn‚Äôt need extra clarification cycles.

#### Example 1: Context Engineering for Tool Descriptions

**Before (v1, verbose):**

```python
@tool
def get_stock_price(symbol: str) -> str:
    """This tool is designed to fetch stock-related data, including price, company name, market capitalization, P/E ratio, and 52-week highs and lows. Use this whenever you need to know about a company's stock."""
```

**After (v2, concise):**

```python
@tool
def get_stock_price(symbol: str) -> str:
    """Fetch stock price, company name, market cap, P/E ratio, 52-week range."""
```

‚û°Ô∏è The shorter description conveys the same meaning but reduces tokens and avoids repetition.

**Token Comparison:**

* v1: \~60 tokens
* v2: \~20 tokens
* **Reduction:** \~67%

#### Example 2: Context Engineering for Sub-Agent Prompts

**Before (v1, verbose):**

```python
fundamental_analyst = {
    "name": "fundamental-analyst",
    "description": "Performs deep fundamental analysis of companies including financial ratios, growth metrics, and valuation",
    "prompt": """You are an expert fundamental analyst with 15+ years of experience. 
    Focus on:
    - Financial statement analysis
    - Ratio analysis (P/E, P/B, ROE, ROA, Debt-to-Equity)
    - Growth metrics and trends
    - Industry comparisons
    - Intrinsic value calculations
    Always provide specific numbers and cite your sources.""",
}
```

**After (v2, concise):**

```python
fundamental_analyst = {
    "name": "fundamental-analyst",
    "description": "Performs company fundamental analysis",
    "prompt": "You are a fundamental analyst. Focus only on:\n- Financial statements (Revenue, Net Income, Assets, Debt)\n- Ratios: P/E, P/B, ROE, ROA, Debt/Equity\n- Growth trends vs peers\n- Valuation (intrinsic value)"
}
```

‚û°Ô∏è Context was streamlined by removing persona fluff ("expert with 15+ years") and redundant phrasing. The new version conveys the same scope but with fewer tokens.

**Token Comparison:**

* v1: \~120 tokens
* v2: \~55 tokens
* **Reduction:** \~55%

### Why Tool Descriptions Matter

* Tool descriptions are always loaded into the agent‚Äôs context.
* Long, verbose descriptions add up quickly because they are **repeated on every query**.
* Short, clear descriptions save tokens while still giving the model enough guidance.
* Example: If you have 5 tools and each has a 100-token description, that‚Äôs **500 tokens added to every query** ‚Äî even if only 1 tool is used.

### ‚ö° Controlling Context for Speed

* Externalize large prompts and configs into `.md` and `.json` files.
* Pass only the **needed tools** and **subagents** for each run.
* Remove unnecessary background text or repetition.
* Result: faster responses, fewer tokens, and no information loss.

## ‚úÖ Quick Checklist

* [ ] Keep tool descriptions under 1‚Äì2 lines.
* [ ] Avoid persona fluff in sub-agent prompts.
* [ ] Externalize long instructions to `.md` and `.json` files.
* [ ] Monitor token counts with `tiktoken` or similar utilities.
* [ ] Set guardrails to prevent recursion loops.

---

## üîÆ Next Steps

* Add multi-company comparative analysis.
* Add streaming responses for real-time progress display.
* Extend UI with charts (price trends, RSI graphs).
* Option to export reports as PDF.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

Version 2 of the Stock Research Agent delivers:

* Cleaner configuration (`.env`, `.json`, `.md`).
* Flexible and optional search provider setup.
* Optimized token usage with **context engineering**.
* Practical learnings on recursion, prompt design, and context control.
* Much faster and cheaper queries without sacrificing depth.

This sets the foundation for more advanced reporting, visualization, and deployment.
